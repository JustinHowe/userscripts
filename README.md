Userscripts

Install either Tampermonkey for Chrome, or Greasemonkey for Firefox, to run these scripts. Microsoft Edge (IE on Windows 10) will supposedly also support these userscripts soon.

GTAV_Cruises Events Magic
This script places a box in the right sidebar that shows all upcoming cruises marked with the "event" flare. The box is titled, "Upcoming Cruises" and is placed above the "Welcome" box after page load. In order to properly work, events must be recorded with proper timezones (preferably GMT, but if PST/PDT/EST/EDT/CST/CDT you better know which one you're currently in and use it right). User error on recording events with non-standard timezones and times will negatively affect that event's display on the userscript box.
